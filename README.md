## Interest Rate Calculator 📱
- This was the first project
- It calculates simple interest and compound interest for almost any of the variables in those equations.

## Battleship 🚢
- This was the second project in the course
- It is a battleship game made using Pygame
- You can place your boats, and then both players will guess the other player's boat along with a UI

## Rock Paper Scissors ✊:
- This project is a simple rock papers scissors game in the terminal
- The user can continue playing until they want to stop
- The scores are saved to a text file and are then loaded from there
