- This project is a simple rock papers scissors game in the terminal
- The user can continue playing until they want to stop
- The scores are saved to a text file and are then loaded from there

- This project uses Scikit Learn, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib which are all used inside Jupyter Notebook as well as Python files
- There is a linear regression class that allows you to perform a linear regression on a csv file of your choosing and data points of your choice
- There is also a classification class that lets you perform multi-class classification on your own csv data

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è
If you'd like to use any of these projects then follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository
2. Go into the project you want to use and run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the `main.py` file and the program should start in either a new window or the terminal
